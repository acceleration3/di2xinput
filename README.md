![Screenshot](Screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

## What is it?
This tool is designed to convert DirectInput controller commands or keyboard inputs to XInput counterparts. The main uses for it are for making XInput controller games compatible with other controllers that use DirectInput as well as allowing games that originally don't support a mix of keyboard and controllers to do so by making the keyboard work as an additional controller instead. 

## Features:
- Uses a per-game configuration basis so different input configurations can be used for different games.
- Different devices can be configured for different players including keyboard inputs.
- All configurations can be changed within the program itself without the need for multiple copies of the program.
